    <h2>A waffle is a dish made from leavened batter or dough that is cooked between two plates that are patterned to
        give a characteristic size, shape, and surface impression.</h2>
    <p>There are many variations based on the type of waffle iron and recipe used. Waffles are eaten throughout the
        world, particularly in Belgium, which has over a dozen regional varieties.
        Waffles may be made fresh or simply heated after having been commercially cooked and frozen.</p>
    <p>For the most traditional experience, top each waffle with butter and maple syrup.</p>
